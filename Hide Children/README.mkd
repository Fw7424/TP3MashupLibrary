# Child Hider

The Child Hider mashup provides a quick and easy way to hide child cards whose parents are already displayed on the board, one-by-one or timeline view.  For example, if you have a feature with four user stories underneath it, the mashup provides a way to toggle showing these user stories when the parent feature is present on the current board.  The mashup provides this functionality as a toggle, so you can freely show and hide child cards with a click of the button.  Your previous setting is saved with the board on a per-user basis.
